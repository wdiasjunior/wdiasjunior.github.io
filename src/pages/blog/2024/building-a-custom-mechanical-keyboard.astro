    <H2 title="Down the rabbit hole" />
    <p>
      After being introduced by a friend to the world of custom mechanical keyboards
      and buying my first actual brand new keyboard that wasn't some hand-me-down
      old PS2 membrane keyboard, I was pretty happy with my Logitech K835 with
      red linear switches, but that changed when I started browsing subreddits
      learned about (almost) all different kinds of keyboards, layouts, sizes, etc.
    </p>
    <!-- <img src="/src/img/old-membrane-keyboard.jpg" alt="old membrane keyboard" /> -->
    <p>
      At first I became interested in smaller keyboards, around 60% and then the smaller
      40%, which was actually just my brain trying to convince me that I would need
      a smaller keyboard to take to university and or to work (I work remote).
      I was sucked into the hobby, and my wallet was already sweating at this point.
      That led to me discovering ortholinear layouts and I eventually found about
      split and ergonomic keyboards and became familiar with all the jargon around it.
      I remember thinking "huh, I thought these weird looking keyboards were just some
      movie prop made for the 'hacker' characters".
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, I got so into it that I started researching what it takes to build a keyboard
      from scratch, reading articles, watching countless youtube videos, and what seemed
      so complicated at first turned out to be a lot simpler.
    </p>

    <H2 title="The layout" />
    <p>
      I considered a lot of different layouts at first. From the most common to
      the most niche of layouts. I eventually settled with the idea of creating
      my own keyboard layout and I went through about 6 major revisions. At first,
      I wanted a ABNT layout since I've been typing in portuguese my whole life,
      but my current keyboard at the time had an english layout, and by then I
      was pretty much used to it, so I changed my mind, again.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the language for the layout defined, I began trying out different ideas
      in this <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/">Layout Editor</a>
      and settled on a weird variation of the standard engligh layout that is also
      ortholinear, and split in half.
    </p>
    <PostIMG
      src="/src/img/split-keyboard-layout.jpg"
      alt="split keyboard layout"
      subtitle="split keyboard layout"
    />
    <p>
      I know I could've (and probably should've) made it smaller, more ergonomic
      and relying on multiple layers for all the less used keys, but whatever. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    </p>

    <H2 title="The parts" />
    <p>
      With the layout in mind I began searching AliExpress for the best deals on
      parts, since this was my first time venturing into this insanely expensive
      hobby (and since I live in Brazil, and conversion rates SUCK here), I decided
      on the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>2x Raspberry Pi Pico</li>
      <li>100x Red Linear Gateron Switches</li>
      <li>1x set of stabilizers</li>
      <li>Keycaps with Japanese legends to satisfy the weeb in me</li>
      <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Curabitur id scelerisque ipsum.
      Vestibulum libero turpis, rhoncus eget turpis at, dapibus tincidunt tellus.
      Vivamus finibus ante quis eros maximus, quis volutpat odio sollicitudin.
      Donec finibus semper cursus. In id commodo leo. Donec congue sed sapien

      venenatis magna sagittis, ultricies dictum sem vestibulum. Mauris mauris
      eros, pulvinar a mi sit amet, mollis molestie turpis.
    </p>

      Integer imperdiet lectus in dapibus faucibus. Curabitur ac volutpat ex.
      Curabitur sit amet velit quam. Nulla pharetra maximus elit quis pretium.
      Suspendisse quam quam, vehicula et velit non, pellentesque pulvinar lorem.
      Etiam mauris risus, luctus sed pharetra at, lobortis et felis. Phasellus
      venenatis sed erat vitae eleifend.
    </p>

    <H2 title="The firmware" />
    <p>
      After some research on firmwares for custom keyboards I saw that by far
      the most popular was QMK, with ZMK being the new flashy alternative. So I
      began reading the documentation and
       to use and , I figured I would try KMK
      and see
    </p>

    <H2 title="An abomination" />

    typing speed - never been a fast typer
    confort
    split - learn to touch type
    customizability - firmware, layers
    looks pretty damn cool
    interconnect problems
    totally worth it!

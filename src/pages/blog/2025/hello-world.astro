Hello world

apparently every blog needs one of these

I've always wanted a blog/website to call my own, and with the rise of
social media, AI slop and enshittification, I decided to take matters into my
own hands, to try and bring back some of the charm of the 90s and early 2000s era
internet back to life.


what did I use to build this
astro
why?
because it's simple and I like simple and easy to use things
I don't want to touch wordpress with a 10ft pole
this site's firt 2 iterations were built with just good ol' html, css and vanilla js for some click events on the dumb menu I had made
astro is great, by the way. you should give it a try.
anyway, this site is lightweight, fast, simple and looks pretty good (I'm no designer, but hey, it does the job, right?).


why am I writing this blog in english if I'm brazilian?
english, for better or for worse became the universal language used in planet earth,
so I'm killing two birds with one stone. I reach a wider audience and get to practice my second language more often







update css to make it work in older devices?

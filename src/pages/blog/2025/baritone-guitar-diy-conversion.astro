bought a cheap guitar on facebook marketplace
bought a baritone strat conversion neck on ebay
stripped the guitar's paint only to find out it is made out of plywood
sunk cost falacy i guess
bought some expensive automotive paint and clear coat
painted at home with a cheap air 

bought pick-ups from a brazilian brand called malagoli
made a custom pickguard since this guitar does not use the standard strat mounting holes

wired up the pick-ups with a 5 way switch using the following configuration

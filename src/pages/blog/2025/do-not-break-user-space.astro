linus torvals is a great influence to me
there's something specifically that he often speaks about in the kernel's mailing list
"we do not break user-space"
as a web dev and open source advocate, having to deal with constant breaking changes in npm packages...
that's not a good way to collaborate

i'm talking to you vtex
get your shit together
stop making your packages as obtuse and convoluted
stop breaking user-space if you're not even releasing a major version (which is the only time someone would expect this)

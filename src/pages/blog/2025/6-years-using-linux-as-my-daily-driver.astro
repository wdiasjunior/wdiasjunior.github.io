long story short
TLDR
one of the best decisions of my life
windows/microsoft sucks
enshittification

---

my first introduction to linux was back in grade school, when I was around 10,
and a friend of mine told me he had bought a magazine and that it came with a cd, Ubuntu and that it is a free operating system
back then I thought it was pretty cool and looked up some screenshots online, so I asked him to borrow it to make a copy but ended up never trying it
(whilst writing this I found the copy I made and it's version 10.04)

fast forward 5 years, I'm in high school, and I have pretty bad internet, so I thought, why not try to hack the neigbours wifi
and found out about kali linux, installed it in a VM but I never managed to acomplish anything with it, so I gave up

another 4 years pass and I'm in college, I decide to finally give linux a try and installed xubuntu on my old laptop since it was having a hard time
running windows, and take it to class. I barely used it

another 2 years pass, the year is 2019 and I am fed up with microsoft and the enshittification of windows 10, enforcing of automatic updates
mid work/gameplay and being treated like I am not capable of making my own decisions using my own hardware.
I decided to finally make the switch to linux, and in the process of following some **dubious** tutorials on how to to install linux,
I ended up dd'ing my drive trying to make a bootable usb with dd and losing quite a bit of data. but even then I was determined, and would not go back.
I stuck with it and gave it another try. I started off with Ubuntu, my first introduction to linux almost 10 years before, and it completely changed me

after that I don't even want to use windows with a 10ft pole. unfortunately online gaming and anti-cheat sucks for linux users
battlefield 1 and 5 used to work on linux???? and the new battlefield 6 requires kernel level anti-cheat

i caved in. i installed windows 11 on another ssd just so i can play battlefield again with my friends
what a horrible experience
I immidiately had to run a debloat script (christitus) to make the experience just a little more bearable

using my computer was suddenly fun again. I was learning and configuring the system to my likings.
a sense of freedom and power that I can't really put into words.

tried ubuntu for 6 months, then debian for more 6 months,
started experimenting with wine and some stuff like adobe and games
gaming was a bit rough in 2019 but worked surprisinly well, and with time it has only gotten better
to my surprise, everything just worked. even my audio interface that was such a pain in the ass to setup on windows,
with asio4all and proprietary drivers, not being able to properly select between inputs and outputs, it just worked; plug and play.
using reaper for my music production hobby was a blast on linux. using my windows VSTs through wine with linvst, and eventually switching to yabridge

trying different DEs, then got fed up with debian's and ubuntu's package update cycle, and having to add PPAs every time, I decided to try manjaro;
and I fucking loved it. used it for 4 years,
with the only problems being related to nvidia drivers breaking after pretty much every other system update,
since I had a gtx660, a gpu from 2012, but I managed my way through.

in 2022 i finally upgraded my computer, after daily driving a core i5 3470 and gtx660 since 2013, that served me really well, but after starting my career
as a software engineer and wanting to play newer games it started to show it's age a lot more frequently

in 2023 I bought a steam deck, gaming on linux just works for single player games

in 2024 I made the switch to arch, and I gotta say, this is the best experience I've had
